# IsInIDE
## The question "is in IDE" answered in 6 different ways  
For some debugging reasons you may want to know during runtime whether the program is running in the IDE, or 
runs compiled as exe on the user-computer.
Here are 6 different solutions to show you how you could deal with this problem, and when to use which trick,
if you have standard.exe, or you are inside or outside of a User-Control. Plus the one and only function, you 
need to solve all those problems.
Well you might say, for what reason do i need such a function in VBA, because of course you can not exe-compile 
in VBA, but in Visual Basic (classic) nowadays I want to focus on code that runs in every possible situation,
from VB-Classic to VBA7.
